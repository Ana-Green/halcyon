# halcyon
InWorldz Halcyon 3D virtual world simulator.

Halcyon was originally based on the OpenSimulator project but was forked in 2010 to provide a stable platform for everyday use under high load. We have concentrated on performance and stability to provide a strong, stable base for the InWorldz grid - and now your grid too!
