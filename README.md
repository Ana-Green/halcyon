InWorldz Halcyon 3D virtual world simulator.

Halcyon is based on the OpenSimulator project, with many custom modifications to make a strong, stable base for the InWorldz grid - and now your grid too!

# Tested operating systems
At this time, only the following operating systems are being tested against:

* Microsoft Windows 7
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2

Open source contributions are very welcome - especially as regards testing on other operating systems. We are actively trying to get the code to run well on Linux, but are being held up by the need for a .NET wrapper for nVidia's PhysX simulator that will work in that environment.
